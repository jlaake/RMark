\title{Export capture-history data to MARK .inp format}
\usage{
export.chdata(data, filename, covariates = NULL, replace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{processed data list resulting from process.data}

\item{filename}{quoted filename (without .inp extension)}

\item{covariates}{vector of names of covariate variables in data to include}

\item{replace}{if file exists and replace=TRUE, file will be over-written}
}
\value{
None
}
\description{
Creates a MARK .inp file from processed data list that can be used to create
a MARK .dbf file for use with MARK directly rather than with the RMark
package.
}
\details{
The default is to include none of the covariates in the processed data list.
All of the covariates can be passed by setting covariates="all".

After you have created the MARK .dbf/.fpt files with the exported .inp file,
then you can use \code{\link{export.chdata}} to export models that can be
imported into the MARK interface.  However note the following: ***Warning***
Make sure that you use the .inp created by \code{\link{export.chdata}} with
your processed data to create the MARK .dbf file rather than using a
separate similar .inp file.  It is essential that the group structure and
ordering of groups matches between the .inp file and the exported models or
you can get erroneous results.

\donttest{
data(dipper)
dipper$numeric.sex=as.numeric(dipper$sex)-1
dipper.processed=process.data(dipper,group="sex")
export.chdata(dipper.processed, filename="dipper", 
          covariates="numeric.sex",replace=TRUE)
file.remove("dipper.inp")
}
#
# Had sex been used in place of numeric.sex in the above command, 
# MARK would have been unable to use it as a covariate
# because it is not a numeric field
